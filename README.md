# LogicEncoder — Python/FastAPI Realtime Portfolio

This portfolio is a practical map of what I build.
I am self-taught, built these systems from zero, and keep improving by shipping, measuring, and iterating.

Most implementation repositories are private (IP protection), but each major app has a public overview with architecture, feature scope, and screenshots.

## What I Focus On

- Python + FastAPI backends (async-first)
- Realtime systems (WebSocket + REST)
- Data-heavy dashboards and practical analytics (finding useful signals in large streams)
- Performance-minded architecture (aggregation, caching, low-resource operation, non-blocking flows)
- Fast AI-assisted delivery (Windsurf as primary, plus Cursor/Claude-style workflows when useful)

## Core Stack I Use

### Backend
- Python
- FastAPI
- AsyncIO
- Web3 integrations
- API-first service design

### Frontend
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript dashboards
- WordPress-based frontend delivery on selected production setups
- Custom WordPress theme work + plugin development in PHP
- React/Vite on selected projects
- Vue and vanilla JS when they fit the delivery goal

### Data & Database Approach
- SQLite/JSON/in-memory/cache-style storage where it fits product constraints
- Database choice based on workload, latency profile, and deployment limits (not SQL-only)
- Practical analytics pipelines for sorting, filtering, and ranking high-volume event data

### Infrastructure / Ops
- Self-hosted processing with controlled public exposure
- Shared-hosting-aware frontend strategy where needed (low RAM / constrained environment)
- Dockerization when architecture reaches stable deployment stage
- Monitoring/diagnostic dashboards and runtime metrics

## Requirement -> Evidence (Quick HR Match)

| Typical requirement | Evidence in portfolio |
|---|---|
| Python backend development | FastAPI-based backend systems across MEXC, ETH Gas Tracker, DNX Swap, ETH Swaps Monitor |
| Realtime architecture | WebSocket + REST hybrid patterns documented in all overview repos |
| Performance optimization | Low-latency dashboards, caching/aggregation patterns, and low-resource hosting constraints handled in production workflows |
| Data analytics mindset | Gas heatmaps, trend analysis, ranked event feeds, and signal-focused dashboard design |
| Practical frontend delivery | HTML/CSS/JS operator UIs + live WordPress frontend deployments + custom PHP plugins/themes |
| Architecture communication | `https://github.com/logicencoder/react-vite-architecture-for-dummies` + structured architecture sections in overviews |
| Tooling flexibility | Windsurf-primary workflow with Cursor/Claude support when it improves delivery speed/quality |
| Learning velocity | Built stack independently from zero and continuously expand tools based on project requirements |

## Supporting Public Repositories

- `https://github.com/logicencoder/react-vite-architecture-for-dummies` (my architecture documentation template/style for readable handoff)
- `https://github.com/logicencoder/hardware-monitor` (runtime observability tooling)
- `https://github.com/logicencoder/dynex-0xdnx-dhip-richlist-monitor` (blockchain analytics dashboard)

## How I Work

- Start with deep requirement/domain research before implementation
- Build from concrete problem to working version quickly
- Keep architecture readable so another developer can follow it
- Optimize continuously for speed, low resource usage, and non-blocking behavior
- Use prompt-engineering playbooks and AI workflows to accelerate repetitive/problem-structuring tasks
- Learn missing tools fast when needed
- Prefer honest capability statements over inflated claims

## Experience Statement (Honest)

I built and learned this stack independently from zero by shipping real projects.
I do not claim to know everything; I focus on learning fast, solving practical problems, and delivering systems that work.

## Availability

Open to roles focused on Python/FastAPI backend, realtime systems, practical analytics delivery, and production-minded optimization.
